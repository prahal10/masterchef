Heat enough water with salt until it begins to boil. Add the pasta and cook the pasta until they are al dente. When done, strain them in a colander or strainer. Drain and set them aside. Rinse the mushrooms well in water in a strainer or colander. Drain them. Trim the stalks and slice them. Set aside. Chop the bell pepper and set aside. Peel and finely chop the onions and garlic. Sautéing Mushrooms Melt butter in a pan. Add the garlic and saute for about 10 to 12 seconds on a low flame. Add the chopped onions and saute till the onions become translucent. Add the sliced mushrooms and saute on a low to medium flame till the mushrooms have shrunk in size. There should be no moisture in the pan. The mushrooms will release their juices initially and after continuous sauteing, the juices will evaporate. Keep on stirring at intervals while sautéing mushrooms. After the liquids have evaporated and the mushrooms have cooked, add the chopped bell pepper and sauté for 4 to 5 mins on a low flame.
